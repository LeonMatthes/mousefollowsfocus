  "description": "It makes the mouse follow your keyboard focus. Whenever you focus a window it will jump to the last position of the cursor inside the window or the windows center, making it easy to interact with it.\nAre you a power-user?\nDo you like using Super+1,2,3 to access your favorite apps?\nAre you annoyed that you have to manually move your mouse between screens because it can't keep up with your keyboard shortcuts?\nThen this extension is for you!\n\nThis simple GNOME shell extension does the opposite of the 'focus follows mouse' setting.",
